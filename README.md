# Mock Rolos Workflows
Replaces Rolos workflows with mocks, leaving empty husks to be unleashed on unsuspecting audience
## Installation
1. Clone the repository
3. If you intend to replace the scripts in the nodes, add `mock.sh` to the root of your Rolos project. You can use the included version, or create your own.
3. Install as a Chromium extension using the [developer mode](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/development-basics/#load-unpacked)
4. Just to be on the safe side, you might want to disable the extension after use
## WARNING
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM. NEITHER THE EXTENSION, NOR ROLOS BACK UP. IF YOU MESS UP YOUR WORKFLOWS, BAD LUCK.
